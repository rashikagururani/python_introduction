Problem set -2
1.Have the user input a semi-annual salary raise semi_annual_raise (as a decimal percentage)

2.After the 6 th month, increase your salary by that percentage. Do the same after the 12th th month, the 18 month, and so on.

Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you save up enough money for a down payment. LIke before, assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (or 4%) and the required down payment percentage is 0.25 (or 25%). Have the user enter the following variables:

1.The starting annual salary (annual_salary)

2.The percentage of salary to be saved (portion_saved)

3.The cost of your dream home (total_cost)

4.The semiannual salary raise (semi_annual_raise)
